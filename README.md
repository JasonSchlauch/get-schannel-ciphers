# get-schannel-ciphers
List enabled SCHANNEL ciphers (Windows).

#### Word of warning
Windows needs a reboot every time you enable/disable/change_cipher_order.
The cipher suite will still show up in this list even if the system was not rebooted 
(i.e. the cipher suite is not yet active but shows up).
